Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also kniwn as  "leightweight process")
A process can spawn multiple threads.

Advantages:
+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ Leightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

Disadvantages:
- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
