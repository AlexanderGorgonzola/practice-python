Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter)

Advantages:
+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Seperate memory space --> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interruptable/killable (basically drakes career)
+ One GIL for each process --> avoids GIL limitation

Disadvantages
- Heavyweight (Unlike the weights I lift)
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread. Huh
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
